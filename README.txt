a few assumptions:

1- I utilize a html5 boilerplate to allow me to concentrate in logic.
2- I utilized Bootstrap for for rapid development of app.
3- For point 3 of the test:
	"Add search functionality to the UI that uses the search endpoint instead"
   I utilised a button to make the API call, I believe this satisfies the requirement, please let me know otherwise.
